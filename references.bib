abstract="Episodic Memory (EM) abilities are important for many types of intelligent virtual agents (IVAs). However, the few IVA--EM systems implemented to date utilize indexed logs of events as the underlying memory representation, which makes it hard to model some crucial facets of human memory, including hierarchical organization of episodes, reconstructive memory retrieval, and encoding of episodes with respect to previously learnt schemata. Here, we present a new general framework for EM modeling, DyBaNeM, which capitalizes on bayesian representation and, consequently, enables modeling these (and other) features easily. By means of a proof-of-concept implementation, we demonstrate that our approach to EM modeling is promising, at least for domains of moderate complexity.",

abstract="This chapter gives an introduction to pattern recognition and machine learning via K-nearest neighbors. Nearest neighbor methods will have an important part to play in this book. The chapter starts with an introduction to foundations in machine learning and decision theory with a focus on classification and regression. For the model selection problem, basic methods like cross-validation are introduced. Nearest neighbor methods are based on the labels of the K-nearest patterns in data space. As local methods, nearest neighbor techniques are known to be strong in case of large data sets and low dimensions. Variants for multi-label classification, regression, and semi supervised learning settings allow the application to a broad spectrum of machine learning problems. Decision theory gives valuable insights into the characteristics of nearest neighbor learning results.",

abstract = "From Hurricane Katrina to the war in Iraq and US border security, ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) are taking a front seat. They can do work that is beyond human capabilities or that puts humans in harm's way. However, the fact that there are no humans in the vehicle is misinterpreted by some as no humans in the system. On the contrary, ROVs are complex systems that require much human involvement. There are many human factors issues ranging from remote control and soda straw displays to spatial disorientation and automation. Further, there are significant mishaps with a large portion attributed to human factors issues. This panel will describe the state-of-the art in human factors of ROVs through some examples of research in the area. In addition panelists will interact with the audience and address questions centering on the challenges, the constraints, and the successes of human factors considerations for ROVs.",

abstract="Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) play increasingly important roles in many modern militaries. The proven success of UAS during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has created a demand for UAS with varying functionalities and capabilities. UAS are currently performing tasks and playing roles of manned systems in many mission areas. Although UAS are limited in meeting all the required parameters when compared to the manned systems, their low risk, low cost attributes and critical mission capabilities often make them preferable. However, the extent to which UAS can continue defining tomorrow's military missions is not predictable. There is some skepticism and hesitation about operating UAS with minimal human oversight and how it influences the operational effectiveness when the limitations of autonomy or constant control needs are accounted for. Therefore, it becomes crucially important to find out and apply the best match between systems and missions considering the type of the mission and the capabilities of UAS. The emerging challenge is to identify the place of UAS in operational structures and versatile missions, and possibly provide an integrative solution where both manned and unmanned systems collaborate in meeting given requirements in the future of warfare. The aim of this paper is to compare cognitive capabilities of manned systems and UAS, and evaluate them in the context of anticipated future operating environments. The evaluation will focus on the efficiency of systems on the cognitive domain of information environments and their impact on specific missions. The research is expected to contribute to a more informed structural transformation of modern militaries.",
